# Web Extension - Alphabetical Tab Sort & Tab Count Indicator

Chrome extension that enhances tab management by providing an Alphabetical Tab Sort feature, which allows users to sort their tabs alphabetically, and a Tab Count Indicator that changes the extension icon based on the number of open tabs: green: <= 5 tabs, orange: <= 10 tabs, and red when a maximum limit is exceeded. 






## How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This Chrome extension was created using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It leverages Chrome's extension APIs to interact with browser tabs, allowing for dynamic sorting and icon updates based on tab counts. It features a user-friendly popup interface where users can turn the sorting of tabs on or off. The state of this toggle is remembered across sessions using Chrome's local storage.

## Lessons Learned

Building this Chrome extension was a great learning experience. I gained hands-on experience working in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and dove into how Chrome's extension APIs work. One of the trickiest parts was figuring out how to use Chrome's storage to remember user preferences, and it took some trial and error to save the settings without causing unwanted transitions.
